# AdvancedNodeStarter
npm run dev

# Experience with this project
Pagination of any sort I have not done before so I looked up examples

# Challenges
As usual - setting up environment
Test - I don't any test library

# 1
I am used to creating own api's and sending without sorting so a bit of thinking what stakeholder would expect - in this case Accenture dev team

# 2
I haven't bothered to use React hooks like useReducer and others like useContext because it is that much of a large project although challening enough in this short time

# Impovements
I would like to better my logic and learn more of our industry's best practices
